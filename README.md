# Technical Data Analytics Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository focuses on **Technical Data Analytics using Machine Learning**, covering various **data processing, analysis, and predictive modeling techniques**. It includes implementations of **statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization** to extract insights from technical datasets.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing distributions, correlations, and trends in the dataset.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing regression, classification, and clustering algorithms.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparing performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and RMSE.  
- **Deployment & Automation**: Options for integrating models into real-world applications.
